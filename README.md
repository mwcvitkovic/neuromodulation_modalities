## Chemical
There are too many chemicals to list, so instead here are the key mechanisms and effects by which we categorize chemicals, followed by some examples.
#### Mechanisms of action of psychoactive substances
This is a mostly comprehensive list. Most chemicals act by multiple mechanisms.
  - receptor modulation
      - agonism (activates a receptor on a cell)
        - It's actually more complicated due to [biased agonism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_selectivity)
      - antagonism (binds to but doesn't activate a receptor, a "blocker")
      - inverse agonism (binds a receptor but produces an opposite effect)
      - allosteric modulation (binds somewhere other than the active site and increases/decreases activity)
  - enzyme modulation
      - induction
      - inhibition
  - ion channel modulation
      - opening
      - blocking
  - transporter modulation
      - neurotransmitter release enhancement
      - neurotransmitter release inhibition
      - reuptake enhancement
      - reuptake inhibition

#### Neurological and psychological effects of psychoactive substances
This is definitely not a comprehensive list, just commonly used terminology.
  - depressants
      - anxiolytics/sedatives (reduce anxiety)
      - hypnotics (make you sleep)
  - hallucinogens (alter perception)
      - psychedelics
      - dissociatives
      - anesthetics
      - deliriants
      - empathogens/entactogens (emotional openness, empathy, sympathy)
  - stimulants (may cause euphoria, but do not affect perception)
  - mood stabilizers
  - antidepressants
  - antipsychotics

#### Examples
  - caffeine: stimulant; adenosine receptor antagonist (among other things)
